/**
 * check-surfaces.mjs — release guardrail.
 *
 * Every user-facing surface (READMEs, marketplace manifests, the site, the docs)
 * must agree with each other and with reality on the things that constantly drift:
 *   1. the rule count ("N+ rules"),
 *   2. the coverage terms that must appear everywhere (e.g. "MCP"),
 *   3. the site announcement bar pointing at the CURRENT release, not a stale one,
 *   4. every language the pack ships being named on the coverage/docs surfaces,
 *   5. every pack language having a hosted per-language Semgrep bundle, and
 *   6. no em-dashes (an AI-writing tell) in rule messages or any user-facing prose.
 *
 * Checks 4-6 are derived from the pack itself, so adding a language pack forces the
 * docs, the coverage prose, and the bundles to keep up, and the humanized-prose rule
 * is enforced forever. Run before every release; it is also a CI job.
 *
 * The source of truth for the count is the rule pack itself (loadAllRules). Run
 * locally with `node scripts/check-surfaces.mjs` and in CI after `pnpm build`.
 * Exits non-zero (and lists exactly what is stale) on any drift, so a release can
 * never ship a surface that forgot the new feature or the new number.
 *
 * When a new coverage lands (PHP, Ruby, ...), add the term to MUST_MENTION and
 * every surface is forced to advertise it. The count auto-tracks the real pack.
